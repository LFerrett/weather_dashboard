# Weather Dashboard - Let's Hit the Road

## Description

The goal of this application was to incorporate the OpenWeather One Call API into a website in order to retrieve weather data for cities. The user can input any city they are thinking of taking a road trip to and then the current weather conditions of the city will populate on the website. In addition to the current weather, the current UV index is shown, indicating by color, whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Below the current conditions, a five-day weather forecast populates for that city. In order to allow users to compare the weather of different cities, local storage saves the previous cities and they can be accessed again by just clicking on the button.
